# Cache-Simulator
Code that simulates the behavior of a cache with LRU-policy. Implemented in C.

The file containing my work is csim.c. The other files either contain necessary helper functions, instructions or functions designed to test the code (these were supplied by our instructors).

The one exception to this is the trans.c, which contains code written by me. The code takes in a matrix of set dimensions (32x32, 32x64 or 64x64) and transposes the matrix while minimizing the number of cache misses.
