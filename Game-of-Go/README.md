# Game-of-Go
Repo containing Go game - implemented in Typed Racket. Running the code will open an interactive game of Go via the command (play 19 (BoardSpec 'moccasin 24 14 7)) at the very end of the code. 

The game supports piece capture and other basic functions of the game, and at end-game determines a winner. The game also has a timer which can be paused by pressing "p", and can be saved and loaded using "s" and "l" respectively.

NOTE: This code was written in Typed Racket 7.0, and may be incompatible with later versions.
